# Blender-Tear-Off-Menu
Blender Tear Of Menu.
The idea here is to help artists stop repeatedly keep going back and forth from the same menu over and over again because it keeps closing.

## To Do
1. Create a blank window so anything can be added to it and it can be called from anywhere in the UI
1. Automatically populate the new window with the different menus in blender
